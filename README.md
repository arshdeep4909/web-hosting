buttons

  components which were previously created
- Also create a new class and then used pseudo selector to add the
  popular badge on the plan
- a better approach then adding the popular badge mannualy

-just created a normal layout for the media object
-did not define the color and back ground and will fine
tune later when we define the block in which it is layed out

quotes

  section and styled it according to our needs
